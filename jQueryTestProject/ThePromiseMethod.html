<!--
 The Promise() method
 The Deferred object has another important method named Promise().
 This method returns an object with almost the same interface than the Deferred,
 but it only have the methods to attach callbacks and does not have the methods to resolve and reject.
 This is useful when you want to give to the calling API something to subscribe to,
 but not the ability to resolve or reject the deferred. This code will fail because
 the promise doesn't have a method "resolve":
 -->
<script>
    /*
function getPromise(){
    return $.Deferred().promise();
}

try{
    getPromise().resolve("a");
}
catch(err){
    alert(err);
}

*/
//******************************************************************************************************************
<!-- The $.ajax method in JQuery returns a Promise, so you can do: -->
    var post = $.ajax({
        url: "/echo/json/",
        data: {json: JSON.stringify({firstName: "Jose", lastName: "Romaniello"})} ,
        type: "POST"
    });

    post.done(function(p){
        alert(p.firstName +  " saved.");
    });

    post.fail(function(){
        alert("error!");
    });
//This code does the same than the first snippet with the only difference
// that you can add as many callbacks as you want, the syntax is clear because
// we donâ€™t need an extra parameter in the method.
// On the other hand you can use the promise as a return value of other
// function and one of the most interesting things for me is that you can do some operations with the promises.
