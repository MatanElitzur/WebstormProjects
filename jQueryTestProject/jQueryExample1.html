     Caching --> link Asynchronous cache

     When it comes to asynchronous tasks, caching can be a bit demanding since you have to make sure a task is only
      performed once for a given key. As a consequence, the code has to somehow keep track of inbound tasks.

     The caching mechanism has to make sure the URL is only requested once even if the script isn't in cache yet.
      This shows some logic to keep track of callbacks bound
      to a given URL in order for the cache system to properly handle both complete and inbound requests.

     One promise is cached per URL. If there is no promise for the given URL yet,
      then a deferred is created and the request is issued.
      If it already exists, however, the callback is attached to the existing deferred.
       The big advantage of this solution is that it will handle both complete and inbound requests transparently.
        Another advantage is that a deferred-based cache will deal with failure gracefully.
      The promise will end up rejected which can be tested for by providing an error callback:
